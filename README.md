# Snake Client Project
Snake is a classic arcade game where players control a growing line or "snake" that moves around a game board. The objective is to eat food scattered throughout the board to make the snake longer while avoiding collisions with the walls or its own body. As the snake grows, it becomes more challenging to navigate through the increasingly crowded space. The game requires quick thinking to survive as long as possible and achieve a high score.

This is simply a multiplayer take on the game where two snakes exist on the same board

Before you can run this client, you will need to be running the server side which you can download and install from here.
